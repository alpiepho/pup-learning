                  Get started with recurrent neural network (RNN) concepts in a simplified way and build simple applications with RNNs and Keras. RNN is a fast-growing domain within the AI world. Popular groundbreaking applications like language translation, speech synthesis, question answering, and text generation use RNNs as their base technology. Studying this technology, however, has several challenges. Most learning resources are math heavy and are difficult to navigate without good math skills. IT professionals from varying backgrounds need a simplified resource to learn the concepts and build models quickly. In this course, Kumaran Ponnambalam provides a simplified path to studying the basics of recurrent neural networks, allowing you to become productive quickly. Kumaran starts with a simplified introduction of RNN before walking through the process of building a model. He then covers the popular building blocks of RNN with GRUs, LSTMs, word embeddings, and transformers.

                  Deep learning as a technology has grown leaps and bounds in the last few years. More and more AI solutions use deep learning as their foundational technology. Studying this technology, however, has several challenges. Most learning resources are math-heavy and are difficult to navigate without good math skills. IT professionals need a simplified resource to learn the concepts and build models quickly. This course aims to provide a simplified path to studying the basics of deep learning and becoming productive quickly. Instructor Kumaran Ponnambalam starts off with an intro to deep learning, including artificial neural networks and architectures. He navigates through various building blocks of neural networks with simple and easy to understand explanations. Kumaran also builds code in Keras to implement these building blocks. He then pulls it all together with an end-to-end exercise. Finally, test what you learned with a deep learning problem and compare your solution with Kumaran’s.

                  From predicting medical outcomes to managing retirement funds, we put a lot of trust in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, even though we know they are vulnerable to attacks, and that sometimes they can completely fail us. In this course, instructor Diana Kelley pulls real-world examples from the latest ML research and walks through ways that ML and AI can fail, providing pointers on how to design, build, and maintain resilient systems.

Learn about intentional failures caused by attacks and unintentional failures caused by design flaws and implementation issues. Security threats and privacy risks are serious, but with the right tools and preparation you can set yourself up to reduce them. Diana explains some of the most effective approaches and techniques for building robust and resilient ML, such as dataset hygiene, adversarial training, and access control to APIs.

                  AI regulation is here, so you may be wondering how to adapt. And if you’re an enterprise organization, startup, or AI practitioner, you probably already know that there are very few existing training resources for technical teams. In this course, instructor Ayodele Odubela gives you a hands-on overview of how to assess AI for bias and discrimination to create fairer AI systems.

Explore the fundamentals of the latest regulations governing the use of AI technology, as well as how to navigate the different phases of AI audits in technical terms. Learn how federal discrimination laws can impact AI systems, how to audit both high- and low-risk AI, and how to collect, develop, or purchase benchmark data for auditing and policy review. Ayodele shows you the basics of calculating model fairness and what principles to prioritize and why, including explainability, transparency, compliance, and documentation. Upon completing this course, you’ll be more aware of how to use generative AI tools to mitigate algorithmic bias.

                  AI image generation tools enable you to enter a text description and get an image in a flash. For creative pros, these tools can accelerate the creative process and help generate assets. For everyone else, these tools enable the effortless creation of images for presentations and reports—or just for fun.

The open-source Stable Diffusion platform is known for its power, customizability, and ability to be run locally rather than through an online service. In this course, imaging expert Ben Long explores Stable Diffusion, sharing tips for creating effective prompts, using sketches or existing images as prompts, expanding Stable Diffusion through extensions, training Stable Diffusion to render subjects it previously couldn’t, and much more.
