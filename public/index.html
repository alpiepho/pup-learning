      This a summary of all the Linked-In courses I have completed. 
      This is just the direct LinkedIn Learning courses.  There are a number of "Lynda.com"
      courses that were taken before subscribing to the LinkedIn premium plan.
      </p>
      <p>
      This list is generated from a tool called "pup-learning" that can be found

      site to gather the list of courses I have taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you look over the list of courses, there is variety.  I fully admit that
        my attention for some courses was less that other.  My form of bing watching :)

                <li class="details">Most data science training focuses only on key technologies. But real-world data science jobs require more than just technical acumen. When new data scientists change their focus from the classroom to the boardroom, they must be able to empathize, persuade, and lead others if they want to successfully run projects that produce business transformation. This course was designed to help you learn these, and other, nontechnical skills that can help you convert your first data science job into a successful, lifelong career.

There are predictable challenges to be overcome when predictive models introduce change in organizations. Throughout this course, instructor Keith McCormick goes over these challenges and shows how to overcome them. Discover how to confidently defend your turf at work, enhance your own natural curiosity, deepen your commitment to your craft, effectively translate the language of analytics to the language of business, practice diplomacy, and more.</li>

That said, in order to debug an existing circuit—or design your own—you have to actually understand how the individual electrical components work and how to use them together. In this course, join electrical engineer Barron Stone as he shares the knowledge and tools you need to learn exactly that. Barron demonstrates how to build basic circuits using resistors, capacitors, and inductors. He dives into how each component works and shows the common circuits that use them. He explains the difference between alternating current and direct current and how to use an oscilloscope to view electrical signals. Then, he demonstrates building passive filter circuits to remove unwanted frequency components from those signals.</li>

                <li class="details">Job seekers typically understand that there's some sort of digital barrier standing between them and the jobs they see advertised online. And they know they need to use keywords to overcome it. But many aren't familiar with applicant tracking systems (ATS)—the software that acts as a gatekeeper for companies and recruiting agencies. In this course, career strategist Jenny Foss explains how recruiters use this software, as well as how to create a winning resume—one that’s not just a compelling read for recruiters, but also optimized for the ATS. Discover how applicant tracking systems work and how to select keywords to maximize your chances for success. Explore how your choice of formatting, fonts, and graphics can trip up the ATS. Plus, learn about the best type of resume for the ATS, as well as how to rework your own resume to ensure it gets into the hands of the right person.</li>

The D3.js library has revolutionized visualization by making it easier to parse your data and add meaningful interactivity. You can bring your data to life using D3, a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and some SVG graphics. In this course, senior staff author Ray Villalobos explores how the D3 library works, and how you can use it to parse data from different sources and create interactive, visually exciting infographics and visualizations. He reviews the basics—controlling HTML with jQuery-esque selections and modifying attributes through CSS—before moving on to working with SVG graphics, a top choice for graphics in D3 visualizations. He also covers working with D3 methods like scaling, events, transitions, and animations, as well as how to work with data, including connecting to external data sources.</li>

                <li class="details">Java is one of the top-five programming languages, and is used for websites, embedded controllers, and Android app development. This is an introduction to get you started programming with Java. Peggy Fisher introduces the basics: data types, strings, arrays, expressions, loops, and functions. She'll help you control the flow and logic of your code, and create classes using the principles of object-oriented design. Then go a bit beyond the basics and learn advanced techniques for working with arrays, manipulating files, and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that respond to user input. This three-hour capsule course is perfect for developers who need to get up to speed with Java fast, as well as for beginning programmers who want their first taste of this popular language.</li>

                <li class="details">The key to effectively protecting your systems is understanding the attacks you have to defend them against. This course introduces the different types of malware (malicious software) that can be used to exploit a target computer. It covers viruses and worms—malware which can propagate itself onto other computers through removable media or networks—as well as Trojans and backdoors. Instructor Malcolm Shore explains where malware hides, and how you can detect it to protect your networks and systems against cyberattack. He reverse-engineers malware so you can see how it operates, and explains how attackers create malware using automated malware construction kits called “botnets.” Along the way, Malcolm introduces malware analysis tools that are useful for the career of any IT professional.</li>

In this course, cybersecurity expert Malcolm Shore prepares you to take your first steps into testing client defenses. Malcolm provides you with an overview of firewall technology, detailing how firewalls work in both Windows and Linux, as well as how to set up a firewall simulation in a GNS3 network. Next, he goes over web application firewalls, API gateway threat mitigation solutions, and how to use honeypots to detect intruders. Finally, he covers the main ways to manage a suspected intrusion, including how to use the Security Onion intrusion detection system (IDS).

Note: The topics covered in this course are drawn from the Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots competency in the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) body of knowledge.</li>

                <li class="details">Ansible is an easy-to-use IT automation engine. It can transform and optimize tasks such as rolling updates with just a few lines of code. However, many organizations aren't using Ansible modules and playbooks in a reusable fashion; they are reinventing the wheel every time they automate. This training course introduces intermediate to advanced use cases for using the tool at scale. Instructor Robert Starmer shows how to reuse Ansible functionality with roles, encrypt secret data with Ansible Vault, support idempotence, and manage multiple groups of systems with Ansible Tower. He shows you how to string these concepts together to use Ansible in the most efficient way possible: variablizing resources, capturing your ideas into roles, and extending Ansible from simple server management to network management-and beyond.</li>

Likability also helps you succeed once you land the job: Likable employees get more assistance and earn more promotions. In this course, you can learn simple techniques for making yourself a more appealing candidate by shifting behaviors that influence how others perceive you, ultimately becoming more likable to your network and the decision-makers in the hiring process. Dr. Dawn Graham—career director for the Executive MBA Program at the Wharton School and a former recruiter—helps you tap into and enhance your natural likability, build your network, and start off your new role on a positive note.</li>

If you can build your resilience, you'll have an easier time facing new challenges and earn a valuable skill to offer employers. In this course, Kelley School of Business professor and professional communications coach Tatiana Kolovou explains how to bounce back from difficult situations, by building your "resiliency threshold." She outlines five training techniques to prepare for difficult situations, and five strategies for reflecting on them afterward. Find out where you are on the resilience scale, identify where you want to be, and learn strategies to close the gap.

                <li class="details">COBOL is an endangered language. But it once ran 80% of the world's business systems: thousands of mission-critical applications that still exist today. Some companies want to upgrade and transition their COBOL applications to more modern frameworks; others want to stick with COBOL's relatively stable platform. In either case, hiring managers are willing to pay a premium for candidates who know how to take on COBOL's challenges. For this reason, programmers are learning COBOL again.

This course is designed to help new and experienced programmers alike add COBOL (or add COBOL back) to their skill set. Peggy Fisher shows how to get a COBOL development environment up and running and how to start programming. She reviews COBOL's data types and constants, control structures, file storage and processing methods, tables, and strings. Challenges issued along the way will help you practice what you've learned.</li>

                <li class="details">Industrial automation is the use of computers and robots to control industrial processes, like manufacturing, without significant human intervention. Used correctly, automation can increase the quality, safety, and accuracy of these processes. It's the job of the people in industrial automation to design the systems, configure the controllers, and monitor the processes. This course provides an overview of the topic, designed to help anyone hoping to enter the field in a role such as electrical or mechanical engineer, automation technician, or design manager.

Learn about the components and networks involved at each level of automation: field level, control level, and management level. Explore the different devices involved, from the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) on the factory floor, to OPC software that give technicians insights into operations. Instructor Zahraa Khalil, an engineer and educator, also provides an overview of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition), an industrial control system architecture that enables supervision over large distances and multiple sites.</li>

                <li class="details">Arduino, the family of open-source single-board microcontrollers, can power a variety of complex projects, from robots to wearable tech. That said, the technology is relatively easy to pick up, even for those without an electronics background. In this course, Zahraa Khalil covers the basic features and capabilities of an Arduino board, equipping beginners with the knowledge they need to start programming their own projects. Zahraa goes over fundamental concepts, such as how to set up the Arduino board with the Arduino IDE. She also shows how to wire up an LED to your Arduino board and write a program to blink the LED lights. Plus, she goes over pushbuttons, explaining why they are considered inputs to the Arduino board, as well as how to activate an LED with a pushbutton.</li>

                <li class="details">While many technical professionals claim to know and understand OAuth, reality often suggests otherwise. Implementing the proper grant types and the required flows while securely protecting your secrets is challenging at best and catastrophic at worst. Fundamentally, professionals often struggle with OAuth because they misunderstand what it is, what use cases it is particularly good and bad at, and how to integrate it smoothly and safely into their systems. In this course, Keith Casey reviews the basics of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect and shows how to use them to authenticate your applications. He covers tokens and scopes; designing and building the key flows; common security considerations; and more.</li>

                <li class="details">Elasticsearch has been widely adopted in search engine platforms for modern web and mobile applications. Combined with the power of Kibana—which can help to provide analytical solutions on top of your Elasticsearch cluster—this powerful platform adds the capability to answer complex business questions about your data and your customers, as well as serve up relevant results in your applications. Beyond just search, the Elastic Stack provides companies with complex analytics and advanced features like machine learning. Companies large and small use Elasticsearch to identify potential fraud, machines that aren't operating properly, and what users are doing in their apps.

In this course, join Ben Sullins as he dives into the inner workings of Elasticsearch combined with Kibana. Ben provides an overview of the architecture, and then goes over the different deployment methods, and how to best structure your data. From there, he demonstrates how to query data, and how to work with Kibana to present your insights.</li>

                <li class="details">Web Workers is one of the most underrated APIs on the web. It brings multithreading—the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously—to JavaScript. Multithreading with web workers can enhance the performance of complex apps with resource-intense code. This course show how to run parallel tasks with web workers and communicate those threads back to the main UI thread. Instructor Maximiliano Firtman explores the APIs for dedicated web workers and shared web workers, which allow you to share threads between browser tabs. The majority of the lessons use Vanilla JavaScript, which allows you to explore the full potential of the technology, but in the final chapter, Maximiliano also introduces some libraries and frameworks specifically designed for developing with web workers.</li>

                <li class="details">In a field where reproducible results are essential, Docker is rapidly emerging as one of the top tools for bringing efficiency to the work that data science teams—particularly those working in machine learning (ML)—are doing. Creating and developing ML models is often messy. Seasoned data scientists know that different versions of the same software can produce different results. With Docker, you can include the right versions of each needed dependency and library, so no one ever has to do any configuration. After the Dockerfile is built, you'll have exactly what you need. In this course, Jonathan Fernandes helps data scientists get up and running with Docker, demonstrating how to build a Dockerized ML application that can easily be shared. Along the way, he shares common use cases for the tool. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll be prepared to leverage the power of containers in your other ML projects.</li>

It includes over 400 pen-testing programs, and it is the primary tool used by ethical hackers. Using Kali Linux, certified ethical hackers can test networks on their organizations' behalves, to see if they're vulnerable to outside attacks.

This course will give prospective ethical hackers a short overview of the tools in Kali Linux. Cybersecurity expert Malcolm Shore shows how to set up a virtual environment for testing, configure Kali Linux, and install toolsets for information gathering, vulnerability assessment, password and hash cracking, and target exploitation.

Because businesses are connected, they are also exposed. Vulnerability testing helps organizations limit that exposure. This course will help you explore the careers, techniques, and tools behind ethical hacking—one of the most competitive and sought-after IT security skills.</li>

Security ambassador Lisa Bock explains what a sniffer is, and how hackers use it to intercept network traffic. She reviews the seven-layer OSI model, active vs. passive attacks, and the different types of protocol attacks, including MAC and macof attacks, DNS caching and forgery, DHCP denial-of-service attacks, and ARP cache poisoning. Learn how ethical hackers have an arsenal of tools to emulate these attacks and techniques, from examining headers and URLs to capturing images. Lisa relies on Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows, but also introduces other sniffing tools, including TShark, tcpdump, and CloudShark.

In this course, Lisa Bock helps you understand the field values of the protocols and what's considered normal behavior using precaptured packets from online repositories. Lisa helps you navigate through the many features of Wireshark. She begins by stressing the benefits of traffic analysis and discussing how this powerful tool can be used to examine traffic either live from wired or wireless connections. She compares the legacy and next generation versions of Wireshark, demonstrates how to install this tool on a PC and on a Mac, and explores the Wireshark interface. She then moves into deep packet analysis of common protocols such as TCP, IP, DHCP, and DNS. To wrap up, she summarizes working with packet captures, discusses the Wireshark expert system, and goes over how Wireshark can help detect network latency issues. She also illustrates ways to subset traffic and then share captures using CloudShark. Lisa walks participants through the basics, so no previous experience with Wireshark is necessary.</li>

                <li class="details">Docker is the next step beyond virtualization. A Docker image contains everything it needs to run, independent of the Linux server on which it lives: a copy of the operating system, a database, code, configuration files, dependencies, and so on. Images can also be packaged and shared with other Docker admins. Arthur Ulfeldt uses Docker to run complex systems with millions of users and hundreds of containers. Here, he shares his knowledge with you. He introduces the basics of Docker, including its containers, Dockerfiles (or base images), and capabilities for networking, data management, infrastructure optimization, and more. Watch and learn how to build your own containers, as well as how to network and link containers.</li>

The course explains how to use these features and commands for change tracking and collaboration. Learn to navigate the commit tree and review the log to find specific commits. Find out how to create branches to test new ideas without impacting the main project and merge those changes into the project if they work out. You can also reset branches to undo changes and stash changes that are not ready to be committed in temporary storage. Instructor Kevin Skoglund also shows how to set up a remote repository to work with another developer and implement a collaboration workflow to ensure you are working together effectively.</li>

The latest generation of CSS specs offers a better and vastly more intuitive set of tools, but moving from floats to Grid, Flexbox, or both means adjusting how you think. In this course, Christina Truong guides you though this process, from initial concepts to complete conversion, highlighting the different ways to create page layouts with modern CSS. Explore how to work with the display and float properties; use relative, absolute, and fixed positioning for laying out components; create basic Grid and Flexbox layouts; and more.</li>

                <li class="details">Websites are a key part of modern business. Having a professional-looking website adds legitimacy to everything you sell and say. Jekyll is a free, Ruby-based static site generator that can help you build a simple website in minutes—without any plugins or advanced programming. In fact, you may find the static websites you build with Jekyll are dramatically faster, cheaper, and more secure than those built with dynamic platforms like WordPress. In this course, instructor Nate Barbettini explains how to build professional-looking, cloud-hosted websites with Jekyll. Learn how to set up Jekyll, choose a template, add posts and pages, and build your site. Nate also discusses the various deployment options available for publishing: FTP, Amazon Web Services, and hosting services like Netlify. Plus, learn how to set up a custom domain with a secure HTTPS connection in Netlify.</li>

With Jenkins, you can automate build management, continuous integration and deployment, testing, resource management, monitoring and reporting, and much more. This introduction helps you use Jenkins to release and deploy software more quickly and reliably.

First, learn how to set up Jenkins on Mac, Windows, Linux, or inside a Docker container, and find out how Jenkins plugins are used to extend its functionality. Next, configure your first job step by step, leading up to the requisite "Hello, World" output, and learn to make your jobs more useful and portable with parameters. Then explore job scheduling, and Jenkins's convenient aliases for running jobs at regular intervals. The course wraps up with tips for organizing jobs in folders and views and a brief look into pipelines as code-which enable you to execute a series of jobs in stages.

By the end of the training, you should be able to install Jenkins locally or on a virtual machine, create a Jenkins jobs that can be triggered manually or on a schedule, and install and configure plugins to extend the Jenkins framework.</li>

                <li class="details">Communication is a complex art. Listening, making oneself understood, and persuasion are all elements of what it means to communicate effectively. Great communicators must master these skills and apply them strategically, depending on what they’re trying to achieve in a given context. You might use the art of narrative storytelling to get your team excited about a project. In a negotiation, you might deliberately signal a willingness to walk away in order to prompt the other side to action. Or if your goal is to understand the ideas and intentions of a new colleague, you might ask a series of sincere, open-ended questions. This course is designed to prepare you for all of these situations and more, offering tips, strategies, and broad observations from professional communicators in many different roles—from an award-winning actor, to an FBI hostage negotiator, to an astronaut on the International Space Station. Note: Some videos assume a group of learners is available for team activities and discussions. Please use what’s useful and feel free to adapt the lessons to your particular circumstances. This course includes videos from: Alan Alda, Emmy-winning actor, writer, and director Nancy Duarte, communication expert Jeffrey Wright, Tony-winning actor from Angels in America Chris Voss, lead negotiator for the Federal Bureau of Investigation Colonel Chris Hadfield, Canadian astronaut Note: This course was produced by Big Think.

                <li class="details">Data-driven applications depend on remote queries that run through APIs. For years, web services have provided basic support for simple query structures. Those services, however, often constrained developers who needed more granular approaches that provided flexibility without creating a huge collection of unnecessary calls. GraphQL—a query language for APIs that was originally built by Facebook—allows developers to choose the kinds of requests they want to make, and receive information on multiple facets of that query in one request. The GraphQL approach to querying across networks can address a wide variety of large-scale development problems.

In this course, learn how to get started with GraphQL. Eve Porcello walks through the basics of this query language, diving into the data fetching specification, and helping you get up to speed with the syntax and vocabulary of GraphQL. Eve explains how to create basic queries, including how to work with arguments and multiple fields. She also goes into complex techniques for handling data, including working with aliases, fragments, and pagination. Plus, she covers how to edit and transform data with mutations.</li>
