# pup-learning

A tool to gather learning classes completed along with details.

## TODO

- turn on scrolling again
- get all completed
- do we navigate into each? (later)
- clean up commented code
- clean up hardcoded timeouts
- do we keep options/lighthouse as template or make this simpler

- convert json data to .md file
- convert json data to index.html
- add gh deploy step

- randomized login timing to avoid capta
- test with headless
- set up docker/ubuntu/headless

- set up with GH Actions to deploy on commit
- set up with GH Actions to run docker and auto deploy (cron)


## Mac Install

Install npm from the website or homebrew.  You will also need yarn.

NOTE: Normally, you can use either npm or yarn to install modules.  The debug of
Chrome with DNS Manager (mising a valid certificate), discovered that we need older
versions of some packages.  This can be done with either npm or yarn.  We currently only
have this setup with the yarn.lock file.

## Linux Install

For a Unbuntu system, use:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install -y npm yarn
</pre>

For other distributions, please search on Google.

## Install then run

First, there is a one-time setup of enviroment variables like:

```
export PUP_USERNAME=<LinkedIn User Name>
export PUP_PASSWORD=<LinkedIn User Password>
yarn install
```

From a command line:

```
yarn start
```

This should take a few minutes to navigate thru all the tabs.  It takes snapshot images
and saves them in 'screenshots'.  

You can also runs this 'headless' or without a browser window.  Look for 'headless' in site.js.  To verify, you should see the screenshots generated.


## Internal Settings

There are number of things can be changed quickly in the source code.  Eventually they
will be added as program options.

Look for "INTERNAL OPTION".

### Chromium vs Firefox for Puppeteer

Puppeteer can run automated tests with both Chrome (technically the Chromium build) and
Firefox.

### Headless

Headless is the ability to run a web page without showing on the screen.  This mode can
be used for automated testing.  This works with both Chrome and Firefox.

### Screenshots

This feature allows capturing an image of the web page while the test is running. 

### Lighthouse

Only available with Chrome. 

Lighthouse is a performance measuring tools built into Chrome.  This is an up and
coming tool in the general web industry.  The performance and fix suggestions are 
a good metric.

Any json files generated can be visually inspected using the tool [here](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).
